# Mathematics-for-Machine-Learning_Assignments
Assignments including quizs and programs of all three courses in Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization by Imperial College London

This repository contains all assignments of the specialization Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization by Imperial College London. I got full score for all three courses. However, I do occasionally struggle with some problems. There are assignments, especially in the PCA course, that are poorly formulated and require knowledge about python modules. This repository aims to help people who are struggling with the vague instructions and numpy functions that are not introduced in the course. If you are also struggling with the assignments, you could check my codes out. 

However, you SHOULD NOT simply copy the codes. This may result in permanent failure of the course, and will NOT help you understand the knowledge introduced. I recommend you to read and understand the codes instead. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment. (Hopefully)I am able to remember the details of these assignments. Best of luck

Sincerely,

George Wang
